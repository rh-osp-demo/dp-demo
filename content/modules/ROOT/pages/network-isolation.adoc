== Preparing RHOCP for RHOSP network isolation

We will be using a preconfigured set of yaml files in the *files* directory which start with *osp-ng-nncp-*.
There are 3 files for each of the master and worker nodes.

If not already in the *files directory*:

----
cp dp-demo/demo/files
----

. The preconfigured yamls will be applied indivdually:

----
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-w1.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-w2.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-w3.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-m1.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-m2.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-m3.yaml
----

Wait until they are in an available state before proceeding:

----
oc get nncp -w
----

----
NAME                              STATUS      REASON
osp-enp1s0-master1-ocp4-master1   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-master2-ocp4-master2   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-master3-ocp4-master3   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-worker-ocp4-worker1    Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-worker-ocp4-worker2    Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-worker-ocp4-worker3    Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
----

2.Before proceeding we will configure  a *nad* resource for each isolated network to attach a service pod to the network:

----
oc apply -f osp-ng-netattach.yaml
----

. Once the nodes are available and attached we will configure the *MetalLB IP address range* using a preconfigured yaml file:

----
oc apply -f osp-ng-metal-lb-ip-address-pools.yaml
----

. Lastly, we will configure a *L2Advertisement* resource which will define which node advertises a service to the local network which has been preconfigured for your demo environment:

----
oc apply -f osp-ng-metal-lb-l2-advertisements.yaml
----

. Configure the Dataplane Network using a preconfigured yaml file(*files/osp-ng-dataplane-netconfig.yaml*) which will configure the topology for each data plane network.

----
oc apply -f osp-ng-dataplane-netconfig.yaml
----
